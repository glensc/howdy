Duff tells him that all the personal records have been set.  He needs to help set a group record.  The town tries to set a record for the world's tallest human pyramid; but when they fail, they inadvertently set the record as the world's fattest town, which they celebrate.

  "overview": "Homer gets a letter from the library telling him about an overdue book.  He checked it out when Bart was born to have something to read his child.  Lisa suggests that he read them some stories from it now.  Homer starts by telling the tale of the\u2026\r\n\r\na). \"Odyssey\"\r\n\r\nHomer is Odysseus, who delivers a Trojan horse to the King.  After his troops are victorious, Odysseus ticks off the gods by refusing to make a sacrifice.  They take their revenge upon him when they blow him and his crew off course, where they almost meet the Sirens and finally Circe, who turns his men into pigs.  After Odysseus eats his men, he has to cross the river Styx to return home.  When he arrives he takes out the trash.\r\n\r\nb). \"Joan of Arc\"\r\n\r\nLisa is Joan in this retelling of the story of Joan of Arc.  Joan sets out to help lead the French army to victory against the English, which she does, until she is captured.  Joan is found guilty and is about to be burned at the stake, when Marge, not much for tragic endings, changes the ending so that Joan lives.\r\n\r\nc). \"Hamlet\"\r\n\r\nBart is Hamlet and Homer asks him to avenge his death.  Moe (as Uncle Claudius) had Homer killed so that he could marry the queen (Marge) and take over the kingdom.  Hamlet discovers the king's treachery and goes to avenge his father's death.  When he kills the wrong man, he must duel with Laertes (Ralph).  When Laertes dispatches himself, Hamlet kills Uncle Claudius, then himself.  Rather than clean up the mess, the queen also dispatches herself.  Everyone is dead.\r\n\r\nBart can't believe how boring the last story was, but Homer reminds him that is also became a great movie called \"Ghostbusters.\"  The family dances as the theme to that classic film plays in the background.\r\n",

The probing of Maggie's mind reveals to Kodos and Kang the most important thing of all for them; Earth is where there favorite celebrities live.

After seeing a vision of President Kennedy, Lisa is inspired to give gymnastics her best shot.  While Bart is spending time with Grandpa he gets bitten by a Chinese mosquito.  Lisa finds out that her fellow gymnastics students are actually college age, and rather than be embarrassed by her real age, she lets them think she is college age as well.  Bart is diagnosed with \"Panda virus\" which makes him contagious, so Dr. Hibbert puts him in a plastic bubble for a week.  Meanwhile Lisa has started hanging out with college age students at a coffee house listening to Robert Pinsky read his poetry.  Bart starts using his plastic bubble to rescue nerds from the bullies.  Some of those nerds follow Lisa when they think she is up to something.  They find her at college analyzing \"Itchy and Scratchy\" cartoons and Milhouse exposes her.  Embarrassed she leaves and back at home, she gets in trouble for going to college (16 credit hours worth) and her fellow grade school students won't relate with her anymore.  She gets advice from Bart on how to win them back, which she does by making a splash on the cake created for Seymour Skinner Day.\r\n",

  "overview": "When Flanders wins a half-time money shot during a WNBA game, Homer asks him what the secret to his good fortune is.  Ned reveals his secret as hard work, honest living and flossing his teeth, tail and toes.  Also a little prayer now and again doesn't hurt either.  Homer focuses on the notion of the little prayer and when he needs to find the remote for his TV, his own little prayer works.  He begins to pray for a number of things.  His prayer for a new home pays off when he trips into a hole outside of the church.  His lawsuit against the church wins him the deed to the church, since the church can't afford to pay him $1 million.  Homer turns the church into a party palace.  Without a place to preach, Reverend Lovejoy and his wife leave Springfield, when preaching at the bowling alley and staying at Ned's house just doesn't work for the Reverend.  The partying at the church gets out of hand; Marge asks Homer if he is afraid of incurring God's wrath.  Homer isn't so sure, but then the rainfall begins and Homer is struck by lightning.  Soon Springfield has started flooding.  When an unruly mob starts to come after Homer, Reverend Lovejoy arrives on the scene asking for forgiveness on behalf of the town.\r\n",

  "overview": "Lisa dreams of being honored as one of three great Americans, only to be waken by Marge's vacuum.  Marge and the rest of the family have begun spring cleaning.  Bart finds a box of old videotapes.  He and Lisa start watching the tapes that are boring them, until Lisa finds a tape labeled \"BART SAD.\"  They put in the tape, which features an episode of Perfect Strangers and a commercial for a product that fights bad breath for babies.  The baby featured in the ad is none other than Bart, leading Lisa to realize the tape should have been titled \"Bart's Ad.\"  The baby in the ad is referred to as \"Baby Stinkbreath,\" which opens Bart up to name calling by his siblings.  Bart confronts his parents about the ad and Homer tells him he was going to tell him on his \"death bed.\"  They tell him he enjoyed making the commercials and he made a lot of money that Homer invested in a college trust fund.  Homer confesses that he used the money to buy back incriminating photos.  Bart demands the return of his money; Milhouse suggests that he get a lawyer.  He finds a lawyer and tells him he wants a divorce from his parents.  In court, Judge Harm renders her verdict, Bart is emancipated and half Homer's salary is to go to Bart.  Bart moves out and into a loft apartment.  His first night alone he is scared by a rat and runs to the elevator that takes him up instead of down.  The doors open to a loft apartment that contains skateboard ramps, \"skate boarding legend Tony Hawk\" and the band \"blink - 182\" playing live in the corner.  The family comes to visit Bart at his new home, where Bart appears to be living the good life.  Homer makes a plea for his return, but Bart tells them he is taking off for six months to go on the \"Skewed Extreme Sports Tour.\"  At the Springfield stop of the tour, Homer talks Tony Hawk into losing to him in a skateboarding contest so that Homer might win back Bart's affection.  When wins the contest, Bart informs him it was about being cool, it was really about Homer not caring about how he felt.

  "overview": "The kids are getting ready to go back to school.  On the first day, Principal Skinner holds an all school Spelling Bee, which Lisa easily wins, allowing her to go to the state spelling finals.  If she wins there, she can then go Spellympics.  Meanwhile, Homer has been trying Krustyburger's new \"Ribwich\" and enjoying it immensely.  At the state Spelling Bee Lisa wins, but is disappointed with Homer who tells her that \"very serious Daddy business\" is going to keep him away from her celebration.  Homer's daddy business consists of getting more Ribwiches.  He is disappointed when the Ribwich is no longer available.  Another Ribwich fan (and member of Ribwich Nation) informs Homer that the sandwich is going to be tested in other markets and he shows him the tour schedule.  For a moment, Homer considers joining them on their bus tour.  For her spelling efforts, Lisa is rewarded with a double-wide locker and she prepares for the Spellympics.  At the Spellympics, Lisa makes it to the finals.  Homer regrets that he won't be able to attend the finals, as he will be in San Francisco for the last day of the Ribwich.  George Plimpton talks to Lisa about getting her to throw the spelling bee so that a more popular competitor can help keep spelling a viable sport.  For throwing the bee, Lisa is offered a full scholarship to one of the seven sister's college of her choice.  Lisa wrestles with her conscience.  In San Francisco, Krusty stops by and tells the crowd they will no longer be making the Ribwich and he tosses them the last one.  Homer catches it, and offers are made to him for the last one.  He realizes that he's forsaken his daughter's big day for a sandwich and he trades it for a car, which he drives off to Lisa's big event.  At the Spellympics, Homer arrives just in time for Lisa to do her final word.  With her dad present, she blows the lid off of the rigged contest, but then misspells her word in the process.  She loses the contest, but back home in Springfield she is celebrated as \"the biggest winner this town has ever had.\"  They even have her likeness carved into the side of a mountain.\r\n",

The children see an example of his work in the form of his documentary on Krusty Burger called \"Do You Want Lies With That?\"  He starts filming his documentary by focusing on school bullies.  Bart is being featured on camera for his role as a school bully, when he is humiliated by Nelson, the bigger bully.  Principal Skinner tries to divert Desmond's attention by focusing on Lisa.  Desmond easily spots the ruse and gives Lisa some advice that she should pick a path and follow it.  Bart searches for a way to become cool again.  When Nelson shows off a hood ornament he's stolen, Bart decides he needs to do the same, only bigger.  Lisa looks for career direction and finds inspiration at an astronomy exhibit.  Lisa gets Homer to buy her a telescope, only she soon discovers that light pollution from the town obscures her view.  Bart tries to regain his position, as Desmond watches.  He then finds Lisa is circulating a petition to reduce Springfield's light pollution.  It works and lights are put down, yes the stars have come out, but so have the criminals.  Nelson and company steal more hood ornaments.  Bart targets the ornate (Emmy award looking) hood ornament of Fat Tony's car.  Mayor Quimby caves into pressure from the townspeople and restores the lights of Springfield, to the point where it's daytime at night.  Bart and Milhouse were almost able to steal Fat Tony's hood ornament, when the lights go on.  24 hours of \"daylight\" begin to take their toll on the townspeople.  Bart is still scoping out Fat Tony's hood ornament, he only needs the cover of darkness to pull of his crime.  Since he and Lisa want the same thing, they team up to get Homer to go into power plant and overload the city's lights.  Springfield is back in the dark when the townspeople come to protest the lack of lights.  Fortunately for Bart and Lisa a meteor shower begins and that distracts everyone.  In the end, Declan Desmond's documentary \"American Boneheads: A Day in the Life of Springfield Elementary\" is shown.\r\n",

This inspires Homer to decide to write his own Christmas carol, but when Flanders tries to help and begins annoying him, Homer is instead inspired to write an anti-Flanders song.  Homer plays his new song at Moe's where a passing David Byrne overhears it and offers to produce and record it.  The song \"Everybody Hates Ned Flanders\" becomes a national hit and is even covered by William Shatner.  To get away from the over-exposure of the hit song, the family decides to take a vacation to a dude ranch.  At the Lazy I ranch, Comic Book Guy looks for an Internet connection and Lisa is annoyed to find out that the ranch was built on cruelty to animals and oppression of indigenous people.  Lisa wants to go home, until sometime later when she meets Luke Stetson, a junior wrangler who shares her views.  Homer and Bart meet some indigenous people who tell them that they've lost their land to a natural beaver dam.  Homer gets them to agree to build a fair casino, if he helps them get back their land.  Lisa overhears that Luke already has a girlfriend named Clara and her heart is broken.  Lisa encounters Clara and gives her false directions to the dance.  Homer and Bart manage to outsmart the beavers and indigenous people are able to reclaim their land.  At the dance, Lisa finds out that Clara, her competition is actually Luke's sister.  Lisa gets Bart to help her find Clara, who they rescue with the help of some beavers.  The family is set to return to Springfield, when they hear a new David Byrne produced song on the radio \"The Moe Szyslak Connection\" and decide they can afford another week at the ranch.\r\n",

  "overview": "Bart's tree house is destroyed and the Amish are called in to rebuild it.  Because the Amish are master electricians, Bart's new tree house catches fire at its grand opening.  Everyone makes it to safety, with the exception of Homer, who is trapped.  He looks to the family dog for help, but Santa's Little Helper (SLH) is a coward and only saves himself.  It's up to Snowball II to save Homer's life.  Snowball II is made a hero in Homer's eyes and SLH is thrown out of the house.  The dog park is turned into a cat park and renamed for Snowball II.  SLH doesn't look very good in the eyes of his fellow dogs either.  Kent Brockman asks Homer about his cat and any other pets he may have and Homer makes the bold statement that \"I have no dog.\"  Bart and Lisa look to help SLH regain his status as family dog.  Their efforts fail.  A passing photographer spots SLH drinking beer from a can that he is balancing on his nose.  The photo appears in the paper and the owner of Duff Brewery decides its time to replace Duffman with a dog.  The family signs a contract for the brewery's new spokesdog \"Suds McDuff.\"  The new campaign is a hit.  The family stands to make lots of money, until SLH's original owner from the dog track comes to lay claim to his dog.  He uses a tape of Homer's own words against him as proof of his continued ownership of the dog.  SLH is being exploited by his original owner.  The family comes up with a plan to get their dog back.  They find the actor who played Duffman (Barry Duffman) and plan to have him rescue a drowning Homer, when it becomes obvious to the crown that \"Suds McDuff\" is a cowardly dog.  The plan doesn't work, when Duffman turns out to be as cowardly as his replacement.  The shark that tried to attack Homer becomes \"wasted\" on the Duff beer that came out of the keg that Homer was floating on.  As a result, the shark becomes the company's new mascot.  With his gravy train at an end, SLH's original owner returns the dog back to the family.\r\n",

  "overview": "At the Springfield Aquarium, Marge accompanies the kids on a school field trip.  Lisa spots penguins flying and after Bart has shown off his \"flawless pearls,\" which results in him being taken the hospital, where a lack of insurance card keeps him prisoner.  Homer has the insurance card, but is nowhere to be found.  As a solution, Homer gets a mobile phone and a few extra unnecessary accessories, which only leads to him not paying attention to where he is driving.  That is until it is much too late and he drives off of a pier.  Judge Harm takes his license away and Homer is no longer able to drive.  Marge picks up the slack and starts becoming \"Stresserella.\"  Homer walks to Moe's, but much to Moe's dismay he decide to keep on walking and starts getting healthy.  Homer walks to work and is the only employee to arrive, everyone else is caught in a traffic jam.  Marge is frazzled from all her driving, meanwhile Homer sings and walks about the virtues of walking when he is stuck by a car; the driver of the car was Marge.  Marge, who cares so much for Homer, tries to help in his recovery, but Homer perceives that she might be trying to kill him.  It leads to fight, which in turn leads them to see a marriage counselor.  After Marge leaves, the counselor suggests that Homer perform one unselfish act of love to win Marge back, in other words take her to dinner.  Homer decides to one up that suggestion and invites everyone in Springfield (except the Flanders family) to a backyard barbeque in Marge's honor.  Homer joins Jackson Browne in a duet to sing his praises of Marge.\r\n",

  "overview": "When Marge sees Bart and Milhouse incited to violence after watching an episode of South Park, she tries to turn them onto some good television on the PAX television network.  They run out of the room and find themselves outside and bored.  After tying a thread to a housefly, that lands itself inside of the Flanders home, Bart and Milhouse find themselves inside the home, unsupervised.  They cause some damage and find Ned's collection of Beatles memorabilia.  They drink from cans of a 40-year-old novelty beverage and start to get sick.  Ned and the boys return to their home to find the house \"slightly askew,\" and they flee to their panic room and call the police.  The police arrive and capture the boys and Bart pleads that his parents not be called.  The parents are called and as part of Bart's punishment he is sentenced to spending all his time under the supervision of a parent.  He is also no longer allowed to play with Milhouse, who Marge believes incites Bart into his bad behavior.  Bart joins the \"Pre-Teen Braves\" and Homer becomes the tribe leader.  When Homer fails in his leadership skills, Marge takes over.  Marge takes the boys on a nature walk and they meet a Native American who shows them a field that is in need of restoration.  The \"Pre-Teen Braves\" return to the field to begin their clean-up effort, only to discover that the \"Calvary Kids\" that Milhouse and his father are a members of have already done the job.  The two groups go to war and try to outdo each other in doing good.  When the opportunity to become batboys at an Isotopes game is on the line, the two sides redouble their efforts for their candy sales.  The \"Pre-Teen Braves\" lace the \"Calvary Kids\" candy bars with laxatives and believe they are going to win.  Only the senior citizens, in a need of relief from constipation, buy the \"Calvary Kids\" a win.  At the Isotopes game, the \"Calvary Kids\" are delayed from arriving and the \"Pre-Teen Braves\" take their place singing their version of the national anthem.  The crowd becomes angered by the version of the anthem that is being sung and when the real \"Calvary Kids\" arrive, a fight breaks out between everyone in the crowd.  When the image of Marge crying is shown on the Jumbotron, the fighting ends and the sweet soothing hymn of the national anthem of Canada is sung by all present.  In the end, Bart and Milhouse sum it up by saying that they've learned that: \"War is not the answer--except to all of America's problems.\"\r\n",

  "overview": "The family goes to the Springfield Botanical Gardens, where they and the other residents are there to see the blossoming of the Sumatran Century Flower.  When his bar is empty, Moe finds out that is where all his customers have gone and he goes to join them.  With a capacity crowd plus one on hand, Chief Wiggum has to send someone away and he selects Moe.  As a result, Moe is one of the only ones to not be driven out of town by the obnoxious and somewhat lethal (to other plant life) smell of the Sumatran Century Flower when it finally does bloom.  The mass exodus from Springfield results in a huge traffic jam on the Springfield Bridge.  When traffic begins to move, Homer hits the accelerator, only to have to immediately slam on the brakes, because traffic didn't move that far.  The quick stop to family car and the faulty seat restraint that was holding Maggie in the backseat causes her to be launch through the sunroof and over the side of the bridge.  She lands in the arms of Moe, who was perched on the side of the bridge ready to commit suicide.  Moe becomes a hero.  Moe stops by to see Maggie and winds up watching her when Marge needs to care of Grampa, who's out on the street acting crazier than normal.  Moe becomes Maggie's fulltime babysitter.  Moe entertains Maggie by telling her a story; of course it's \"The Godfather\" saga.  Late in the evening after Maggie's birthday party, where Homer began to learn that Maggie prefers Moe over him, Marge and Homer hear Maggie crying.  They go to her room only to find Moe already there calming her down.  They forbid him to ever see her again.  The next day, Moe is lonely and missing Maggie.  That night, outside her window, Maggie overhears Fat Tony and his boys plan to take out the Castellaneta family.  She crawls out her window and begins pursuing them.  Marge discovers Maggie is gone and they immediately suspect Moe.  When Moe doesn't have her and he finds out she is missing, he offers to help.  Clues outside Maggie's window reveal that the mob was gathered outside of her window and Moe suggests that they might find her in little Italy.  At a restaurant in Little Italy Maggie finds she is in the middle of an \"Italian-American Mexican standoff.\"  Moe volunteers to go in and rescue her.  He draws the mobster's attention to Maggie which causes them to all go soft.  Moe returns Maggie to Homer and Marge and prepares to leave; only Maggie doesn't want him to go.  Homer and Marge agree that Moe can have the occasional play date with Maggie, provided he brings along his ham to accompany Homer.\r\n",

It hits him in the chest and then blows away, right across town and into the Simpson living room window, where Bart gets a hold of it.  His parents (well Marge anyway) make him put up a notice so that the owner might have a chance to claim the bill.  When no one can identify the bill, Bart wonders what he can do with his new windfall.  He realizes that he can make money showing off his bill, so he opens up the \"Museum of Modern Bart\" in his tree house.  Mr. Burns makes his claim for the bill, but all is not lost.  Bart has made over $3000 in admissions to his museum.  To make use of the money the family decides to go to England, where Abe recalls having a memorable night with a beautiful English girl named Edwina.  In merry ole England, the Simpsons meet Prime Minister Tony Blair.  Abe tries to find Edwina, meanwhile the rest of the family tours London.  Everything is going fine until Homer slams his rental Mini into the back of the Queen's horse drawn carriage.  Homer is put on trial, makes an ass out of himself in court and is thrown into the Tower of London.  Lisa finds a way for Homer to escape his tower cell, a secret tunnel once used by Sir Walter Raleigh.  Unfortunately the tunnel leads to the Queen's bedroom.  Homer's pathetic plea with the Queen works and the family is allowed to leave the country, provided they take Madonna with them.  Before boarding the plane, Edwina calls out to Abe, and introduces him to her daughter of 58 years, Abbie, a woman who looks like Homer in drag.  Abe runs on board the plane as fast as he can.\r\n",

  "overview": "It's Christmastime and at the power plant Mr. Burns passes out Christmas bonuses, a $5 dollar voucher to the cafeteria.  For reasons unknown, Mr. Burns gives Homer a \"confectioner's card\" for Bart featuring a \"current baseballer.\"  The \"current baseballer\" is Joe DiMaggio and it is his rookie card that Homer brings to the Comic Book Guy, where he gets everything he has in the register for the card.  With this financial windfall, the Simpson family goes Christmas shopping at the Springfield Heights Promenade, where the rich people shop.  Homer spends the remaining portion of his share of the money for a gift for himself (a personalized talking astrolabe) and has no money left to buy the family a nice Christmas tree.  Marge and the kids find out what he's spent the money on and are disappointed in him.  Spending the night on the couch, Homer watches \"Mr. McGrew's Christmas Carol\" and the story works its magic on Homer, and Homer wakes with resolve to be good and unselfish.  Homer starts helping the less fortunate and his good deeds begin to make Ned Flanders' jealous.  To combat against Homer's good reputation, Ned decides to give everyone in Springfield a Christmas present.  Homer decides to outdo Flanders, but on advice from Lisa and her Buddhist view of the world, Homer decides to take everyone's presents.  Homer and SLH (a la the Grinch) sneak into everyone's home and take all of their presents.  The angry mob finds Homer in downtown Springfield.  Ned tries to come to Homer's rescue, but a \"star\" in the sky saves them both and they return the presents.  After Moe's failed annual suicide attempt the whole town joins in a rendition of \"Hark the Herald Angels Sing.\"\r\n",

To get the TV back Bart suggests that Marge buy Maggie a \"Roofi\" CD, which Lisa tries to warn him against.  The warning doesn't work; Marge fills the house and family car with the sounds of \"Roofi,\" which drives Homer, Bart and Lisa crazy.  Marge takes Maggie to an outdoor \"Roofi\" concert being held at Cletus's farm.   The concert turns into a disaster and the babies begin to riot.  After paying $1 million in additional taxes to help pay for the damage the babies caused, the single (and other childless) adults of Springfield join SSCCATAGAPP (Singles, Seniors, Childless Couples And Teens And Gays Against Parasitic Parents) and begin to revolt against children.  \"Children are the future, today belongs to me.\"  Marge takes up the cause on behalf of the children and works to get voter sponsored initiative proposition on the ballot.

  "overview": "Milhouse comes over with a Psycho Cycle bike conversion kit, which they use on Bart's bike to make it look cooler.  While riding the modified bike, they are hassled by older boys with \"big boy\" bikes.  It makes Bart wish for a ten-speed bike.  To get a new bike Bart sacrifices his old bike right in front of Dr. Hibbert's Mercedes.  As Dr. Hibbert leaves his Mercedes then runs over Snowball II and Lisa is devastated.  Bart and Homer get Bart a new bike, but it needs to be assembled and Homer tries to do his best.  The bike falls apart when Bart tries to show it off to the older boys.  Later Bart and Homer are watching \"Robot Rumble\" and the father and son teams inspire Homer to try building a robot for them to enter in competition but Bart leads Homer to believe that Bart thinks he is an oaf.  Marge and Lisa look for a new cat and Lisa finds a new one that she calls Snowball III.  Homer tries to build a robot, but his result is a failure.  Homer looks to his father for inspiration and becomes a robot instead of building one.  Bart wakes to find Homer's robot in his room, which is actually Homer inside of large metal shell powered by a tricycle.  Lisa finds that Snowball III has drowned in the fish tank.  Bart competes on \"Robot Rumble,\" with the robot he's called \"Chief Knock-A-Homer,\" but Homer is nowhere to be found.  Homer, hidden inside the robot, manages to win his first match, but only after he receives numerous cuts and bruises.  Lisa gets (and quickly loses) a new cat named Coltrane.  Chief Knock-A-Homer quickly works his way into the finals, but Bart is sorry that his father hasn't been able to see any of the Chief's victories.  The Chief's final match is scheduled to be against Professor Frink and his son's deadly looking robot.  Lisa, depressed about her propensity to kill cats, is surprised when a crazy lady leaves her with a new cat.  Lisa sees that new cat looks kill proof, and decides to call it Snowball II and forgot the whole dead cat thing ever happened.  After the first round of the finals Bart discovers the secret inside of Chief Knock-A-Homer and thinks his dad is even cooler for doing that.  The match is stopped in the second round when Homer's presence in the robot is revealed to everyone.  The law of robotics saves Homer's life and the Frink robot goes out its way to make Homer comfortable.  Nature's greatest killing machine is declared the winner.\r\n",

  "overview": "Homer is intrigued by a commercial that talks about a contest that will allow the winner, the finder of a golden ticket, a trip to \"Farmer Billy's Bacon Factory.\"  Homer buys a lot of pork products but is only able to find a silver ticket, which allows him to judge the pig competition at the county fair.  When Homer sees an injustice being done to Lisa's entry in the place setting competition, he decides to take action.  Remembering Chief Wiggum's warning about felony assault, he disguises himself as \"Pie Man\" and delivers a pie in the face as revenge.  He disappears as quickly as he came, making Springfield wonder if they will ever see him again.  When Bart gets ripped off by Comic Book Guy, \"Pie Man\" delivers some \"key lime justice.\"  The police decide that \"Pie Man\" needs to be stopped and they shoot him when he makes his next appearance.  He takes time out from his fleeing to save Marge and then kisses her, even though she tells him she's a married woman.  Later at home, the wounded Homer makes a promise to Lisa (who's figured out his disguise) that he will stop his pie avenging.  When Mr. Burns goes too far, \"Pie Man\" makes another appearance, but his escape from the plant is thwarted by his own laziness.  Mr. Burns turns him into his personal hit man.  Homer finds himself in a dilemma when Mr. Burns wants him to deliver a pie in the face of Lisa's Buddhist hero the Dalai Lama.  When he comes clean in front of a crowd, no one believes that he was capable of being the \"Pie Man,\" only his family believes in him.\r\n",

The meal is a success as Kang gets a hyper-galactic promotion. \r\n\r\na). \"The Ned Zone\"\r\n\r\nHomer knocks Ned unconscious with his bowling ball, when he recovers he discovers that he was really dying of a brain tumour & the bowling ball lodged it out (which give him premonitions of doom).  He tells Homer about his new power and Homer wants to know his future.  Ned sees Homer being shot in the back, and the shooter is he.  Ned keeps this information to himself and manages to not shoot Homer.  He then finds out that Homer is going to cause the destruction of all of Springfield by destroying the plant's nuclear reactor.  Ned goes to the power plant to try to prevent the catastrophe.

Rather than hire someone, Homer decides to do the renovation himself.  While demolishing the kitchen, Homer unleashes his old collection of Playdude magazines.  He tells Marge he keeps them for the articles; she obliges him by cutting up the magazines, keeping only the articles.  Now that they are useless, Homer throws them away, only to have them found by Bart and Milhouse.  Using these 1970's era magazines as a model, Bart decides to renovate the Treehouse.  After Homer has made a mess of the kitchen remodeling, Marge is finally able to hire a contractor, who completes the job \"on-time\" two years later for $100,000.  Marge's first new dish out of her kitchen gets rave reviews and she decides to enter the Ovenfresh Bakeoff with her Dessert Dogs.  At the bakeoff Marge encounters stiff and ruthless competition, so ruthless that Marge resorts to cheating to get even, much to Lisa's dismay.  Chief Wiggum and other concerned parents talk with Homer about Bart's spreading the Playdude philosophy to the other children.  Homer has a talk with Bart about the facts of life, which a horrified Bart quickly spreads to the other children.  Meantime, in the finals for the bakeoff against Brandine, Marge admits to her foul play and Lisa's faith in her mother is restored.\r\n",

Homer performs a wild crowd-pleasing dance at a local carnival, after beating Bart's performance in a game.  Ned Flanders has captured the performance on videotape and Comic Book Guy (Jeff Albertson) puts it up on the Internet.  The video gets worldwide attention, much to Homer's embarrassment but his tune changes when a football player wants to buy the rights to use his dance as his own end zone celebration.  Homer turns the opportunity into a new lucrative occupation, which prospers as other athletes come to learn from him.  Meanwhile Ned looks to create his own wholesome entertainment by creating his own versions of bible stories, which get the backing of Mr. Burns.  Marge doesn't like his approach, which eliminates the good aspects of the stories, and only concentrates on the violence.  She threatens a boycott, which gets Burns to remove his financial backing, leaving Ned with no creative outlet.  The commissioner of football (and all the owners) want to talk to Homer, his teaching of crazy antics to their players have increased their ratings.  They want him to choreograph the Superbowl half-time show.  Homer struggles for a show idea and on the night before the big show he still doesn't have one.  Homer looks for inspiration at the church, but instead finds Flanders, who is looking for an outlet for his ideas.  Together they bring the story of Noah to the half-time show, but everyone boos as no one wanted to see such a \"blatant display of religion and decency.\"\r\n",

  "overview": "The family visits Shelbyville and are appalled at the perception those citizens have of the inhabitants of Springfield.  Back in town, Marge brings it to the attention of the Springfield Cultural Advisory Board and then asks architect Frank Gehry to design and build a new Springfield cultural center.  He sees inspiration in her request and submits a design that is approved by the town.  $30 million dollars later, the project is built and it opens and closes quickly as nobody in town really cares for classical music.  Mr. Burns agree to take over the space, with his plan to turn it into a state prison.  Homer applies for a job as a guard, but fails the drug test after Otto switches their samples.  Meanwhile, Bart and Lisa follow Snowball II, when they believe the reason she is so fat is that she is getting food from elsewhere; after following her they discover she has another family.  Burns needs convicts for his prison and Chief Wiggum blows the dust of some old forgotten laws.  Homer is arrested for illegally transporting litter (kicking a can 5 times in a row).  In prison Homer inadvertently squeals on Snake's escape attempt and is drafted to becoming a snitch and he begins enjoy the perks that go along with it.  Snowball II (\"Smoky\") enjoys life with her new family and Bart gets into the home to find out; there is plenty of good eating to be found there.  Fat Tony and his boys try to find out who the snitch is.  They feed Homer information regarding a breakout.  While all the guards are outside waiting for the breakout, the prisoners are taking care of their snitch and a riot ensues.  The riot is stopped and Homer snitches on the conditions of the prison.\r\n",

  "overview": "Springfield is experiencing an unusually strong thunderstorm, and the rain is causing roofs to leak all over town.  Homer devises a unique solution for getting the rain water out of their house that ultimately fails and sends him dejected off to Moe's, where he ruins Lenny's surprise party.  Homer goes off wandering and finds himself at a bar called Knockers, where he makes a new friend named Ray, who is a licensed and bonded roofer.  Marge takes the kids on some errands while Homer and Ray almost begin the roof repairs; they screw around and never get around to doing any work until he gets called away.  Marge wants Homer to fix the roof by himself.  Homer runs into Ray at the Builder's Barn and Ray promises to stop by later and help him with the roof.  Homer waits for him, but Marge is skeptical that Ray even exists when Ray never shows up.  Marge has Homer placed in the mental ward of the hospital and she and no one else can confirm that Ray really exists.  Dr. Hibbert recommends and gives Homer electro-shock therapy.  Six weeks later Homer's treatments are over and to everyone's surprise Ray turns up at the hospital to celebrate Homer's release.  Plausible explanations, even one by Stephen Hawking, are given to explain why no one had ever seen Ray before.\r\n",

They go to the mall with Homer and while getting their haircut they get into a fight, which results in them each getting really bad haircuts.  Out in the mall they are spotted by fellow school students who have cameras in hand.  They find Homer and go on the run; they sneak into the back entrance of a movie theater and see the film \"Left Below,\" which is a movie about the apocalypse.  The images in the movie are disturbing to Homer, who fears the worst.  Marge assures him that there needs to be some ominous signs before the rapture will come.  When Homer is out driving, he sees what he believes to be the signs.  Homer gathers some books on the subject and he calculates that the \"rapture is nigh\" at 3:15 PM on May 18th, seven days from now.  He starts to spread the word and tells everyone on television a passage from Revelations 6:13 that says before the rapture \"the stars will fall to Earth.\"  At the Springfield Stadium, there is a celebrity filled blimp accident that causes the stars on board to fall to the Earth and Homer gains instant credibility.  He gets a bus full of people to join him at Springfield Mesa.  When the appointed time comes and goes, Homer loses credibility and everyone return back to their normal lives.  Homer later realizes that he made a mistake in his calculation and the new time is only 30 minutes away.  When no one in his family will join him Homer goes to the Mesa on his own.  The rapture comes and Homer goes to heaven, but despite all that heaven has to offer, Homer needs his family.  He gets an audience with God, but when God won't grant his request to have his family join him; Homer begins raising hell in heaven.

Lisa decides she is going to make something for her father, while Bart purchases the Leather Buddy multi-function knife.  Lisa\u2019s heartfelt gift doesn\u2019t go over as well as Bart\u2019s knife and Homer doesn\u2019t immediately do anything to make Lisa feel any better.  Bart sees a street sign with his name on it and the bullies entice him into stealing it.  Homer makes a lame attempt at making up to Lisa.  At school Lisa goes on a rampage.

With a number of ridiculous candidates running, Lisa decides that her father, with his popularity as the safety salamander, would be the ideal choice.  With Lisa as his campaign manager, everything is going well, until Marge washes his salamander suit.

The pair evades the tenacious sheep by finding refuge in the mansion\u2019s attic, where Mr. Burns tells her the story of how he came to work at Moe\u2019s Tavern by losing a scavenger hunt with a rich Texan.  While there he learned (and tells to Lisa) the tale of the Moe\u2019s treasure.  The stories within stories culminate in the fate of the treasure being determined in the cave.\r\n",

Howdy Music Command Line Utilities
================================================
This section describes the four Howdy music command line utilities.

* :ref:`howdy_music_album` can do three possible things: download an album image given an artist name and album name; pretty-print out all the studio albums released by an artist; and print out all the songs released on an album by an artist. It uses either the LastFM_ or MusicBrainz_ APIs.

* :ref:`howdy_music_metafill` is an older Plex_ Music executable. It gets choices and song clips from YouTube_ and music metadata using the Gracenote_ API. This was an earlier trial to improve the functionality of :ref:`howdy_music_songs`.

* :ref:`howdy_music_songs` is a work-horse CLI that can do three things (:ref:`download songs with artist and song list <download_by_artist_songs>`, :ref:`download songs with artist and album <download_by_artist_album>`, or :ref:`download a list of songs with a list of corresponding artists <download_by_artists_songs_list>`) using the three music metadata services: Gracenote_ (|gracenote_image|), LastFM_ (|lastfm_image|), or MusicBrainz_ (|musicbrainz_image|).

* :ref:`upload_to_gmusic` uploads MP3_ or M4A_ music files to one's `Google Play Music`_ account, or pushes the appropriate :py:mod:`gmusicapi` :py:class:`Mobileclient <gmusicapi.Mobileclient>` credentials into the SQLite3_ configuration database.

howdy_music_album
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The help output, when running ``howdy_music_album -h``, produces the following.

.. code-block:: console

   usage: howdy_music_album [-h] -a ARTIST_NAME [-A ALBUM_NAME] [--songs] [--formatted] [--albums] [--debug] [--noverify] [-M] [-D]

   optional arguments:
     -h, --help            show this help message and exit
     -a ARTIST_NAME, --artist ARTIST_NAME
			   Name of the artist to get album image for.
     -A ALBUM_NAME, --album ALBUM_NAME
			   Name of the album to get album image for.
     --songs               If chosen, get the song listing instead of downloading the album image.
     --formatted           If chosen, print the song listing in a format recognized by plex_music_metafill.py for downloading a collection of songs.
     --albums              If chosen, then get a list of all the songs in all studio albums for the artist.
     --debug               Run with debug mode turned on.
     --noverify            If chosen, do not verify SSL connections.
     -M, --musicbrainz     If chosen, use Musicbrainz to get the artist metadata. Note that this is expensive, and is always applied when the --albums flag
			   is set.
     -D, --direct          Only makes sense when running with MusicBrainz. Option of using direct instead of indexed search on the artist. Default is False.

These are the common operational flags,

* ``--debug`` prints out :py:const:`DEBUG <logging.DEBUG>` level :py:mod:`logging` output.

* ``--noverify`` does not verify SSL connections.

* By default, this executable uses the LastFM_ API to get music metadata. The ``-M`` or ``--musicbrainz`` flag then means the MusicBrainz_ API is used.

* By default (with MusicBrainz_) we perform an *indexed* search. The ``-D`` or ``--direct`` flag means to perform a *direct* search on an arist with the MusicBrainz_ API.
			     
Here are the three operations,

* Download an album's image to a PNG_ file in the current working directory. Here, the ``-a`` or ``--artist`` (artist) and ``-A`` or ``--album`` (album) need to be specified. To download the album image for the `Moon Safari`_ album released by Air_,

  .. code-block:: console

     tanim-desktop $ howdy_music_album -a Air -A "Moon Safari"
     tanim-desktop $ Air.Moon Safari.png

  Here is the image,

     :width: 100%
     :align: center

.. _howdy_music_album_get_albums:
	
* The ``--albums`` flag gets a formatted, pretty-printed list of albums released by an artist.  Here, the ``-a`` or ``--artist`` (artist) need to be specified. For example, for Air_,

   .. code-block:: console

      tanim-desktop $ howdy_music_albums -a Air --albums

      Air has 7 studio albums.

      Studio Album                         Year    # Tracks
      ---------------------------------  ------  ----------
      Moon Safari                          1998          10

      Music for Museum                     2014           9

* The ``--song`` flag returns a list of songs released on a specific album by the artist. Here, the ``-a`` or ``--artist`` (artist) and ``-A`` or ``--album`` (album) need to be specified.

  * By default, the standard pretty-printed formatting if we do not use the ``--formatted`` flag. To get all the songs in track order for `Moon Safari`_ album released by Air_,

  .. _howdy_music_abum_songs_formatted:

  * If we run with the ``--formatted`` flag, then the output is a semi-colon-delimited collection of songs in this album. This is an input format that can then be processed by :ref:`howdy_music_metafill`. For songs in the `Moon Safari`_ album released by Air_,

    .. code-block:: console

       tanim-desktop $ howdy_music_album -a Air -A "Moon Safari" --songs --formatted

.. _howdy_music_metafill_label:

howdy_music_metafill
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The help output, when running ``howdy_music_metafill -h``, produces the following.

.. code-block:: console

   usage: howdy_music_metafill [-h] -s SONG_NAMES -a ARTIST_NAME
				 [--maxnum MAXNUM] [-A ALBUM_NAME] [--noverify]

   optional arguments:
     -h, --help            show this help message and exit
     -s SONG_NAMES, --songs SONG_NAMES
			   Names of the song to put into M4A files. Separated by
			   ;
     -a ARTIST_NAME, --artist ARTIST_NAME
			   Name of the artist to put into the M4A file.
     --maxnum MAXNUM       Number of YouTube video choices to choose for your
			   song. Default is 10.
     -A ALBUM_NAME, --album ALBUM_NAME
			   If defined, then use ALBUM information to get all the
			   songs in order from the album.
     --noverify            If chosen, do not verify SSL connections.

Here are the common elements of its operation,
       
* the ``--noverify`` flag means to not verify SSL connections.

* the ``--maxnum`` setting is the maximum numbr of YouTube_ clips from which to choose. This must be :math:`\ge 1`, and its default is ``10``.

* the artist must always be specified with the ``-a`` or ``--artist`` setting.

This executable has two modes of operation. In each mode, for each song in the collection, this tool finds that song, finds that clip, and asks the user to select a clip with a number from ``1`` to at most ``maxnum``. For convenience, each YouTube_ clip also shows its duration in MM:SS format. For example, here I choose YouTube_ clip #1 for the first track in the `Moon Safari`_ album released by Air_,

.. code-block:: console

* In the first mode of operation, give it a list of songs separated by semicolons. The format of songs is described in :ref:`this bullet point <howdy_music_abum_songs_formatted>`, e.g.,

  .. code-block:: console

     La Femme d'Argent;Sexy Boy;All I Need;Kelly Watch the Stars;Talisman;Remember;You Make It Easy;Ce Matin-Là;New Star in the Sky (Chanson Pour Solal);Le Voyage De Pénélope

  For songs in order in the album `Moon Safari`_ by Air_. Below is an animation showing how this works in practice when downloading these songs. Here we always choose YouTube_ clip #1.

  .. _howdy_music_metafill_songs:

  .. youtube:: PflzMfN4A9w
     :width: 100%

  The list of songs came from the LastFM_ service, and Gracenote_ cannot find Air_ songs in `Moon Safari`_ with the names ``Ce Matin-Là`` and ``Le Voyage De Pénélope`` due (probably) to diacritical accents.

* In the second mode of operation, give it the album name with ``-A`` or ``--album``. For example ``howdy_music_metafill -a Air -A "Moon Safari"`` to get all ten songs in this album,

  .. _howdy_music_metafill_album:
  
  .. youtube:: OMu5wpb49Sw
     :width: 100%

  Here Gracenote_ is able to find all songs, including ``Ce Matin La`` (instead of ``Ce Matin-Là``) and ``Le Voyage De Penelope`` (instead of ``Le Voyage De Pénélope``).
  
.. _howdy_music_songs_label:

howdy_music_songs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The help output, when running ``howdy_music_songs -h``, produces the following.

.. code-block:: console

   optional arguments:
     -h, --help            show this help message and exit
     -a ARTIST_NAME, --artist ARTIST_NAME
			   Name of the artist to put into the M4A file.
     -s SONG_NAMES, --songs SONG_NAMES
			   Names of the song to put into M4A files. Separated by ;
     --maxnum MAXNUM       Number of YouTube video choices to choose for each of your songs.Default is 10.
     -A ALBUM_NAME, --album ALBUM_NAME
			   If defined, then get all the songs in order from the album.
     --new                 If chosen, use the new format for getting the song list. Instead of -a or --artist, will look for --artists. Each artist is separated by a ';'.
     --artists ARTIST_NAMES
			   List of artists. Each artist is separated by a ';'.
     -L, --lastfm          If chosen, then only use the LastFM API to get song metadata.
     -M, --musicbrainz     If chosen, use Musicbrainz to get the artist metadata. Note that this is expensive.
     --noverify            Do not verify SSL transactions if chosen.
     --debuglevel {NONE,ERROR,INFO,DEBUG}
			   Choose the debug level for the system logger. Default is NONE (no logging). Can be one of NONE (no logging), ERROR, INFO, or DEBUG.
     -D, --direct          Only makes sense when running with MusicBrainz. Option of using direct instead of indexed search on the artist. Default is False.

In all three operations, here are required arguments or common flags,

* ``-a`` or ``--artist``: the artist must always be specified.

* ``--maxnum`` specifies the maximum number of YouTube_ video clips from which to choose. This number must be :math:`\ge 1`, and its default is ``10``.

* ``--noverify`` does not verify SSL connections.

* ``--debuglevel`` specifies the amount of system logging into STDOUT that you want to show. The default choice is ``NONE`` (no logging). Here are the loging levels.
  
  * ``ERROR``: :py:const:`ERROR <logging.ERROR>` level :py:mod:`logging` output.
  
  * ``INFO``: :py:const:`INFO <logging.INFO>` level :py:mod:`logging` output.

  * ``DEBUG``: :py:const:`DEBUG <logging.DEBUG>` level :py:mod:`logging` output.

* ``--level`` prints out :py:const:`DEBUG <logging.DEBUG>` level :py:mod:`logging` output.

* ``-D`` or ``--direct`` only makes sense with the MusicBrainz_ operation. With the MusicBrainz_ API we perform an *indexed* search. The ``-D`` or ``--direct`` flag means to perform a *direct* search on an arist instead.

     - `Download artist & album <yt_clip2_>`_
     - `Download sep artists & songs <yt_clip3_>`_
  
The complicated collection of flags and arguments allows ``howdy_music_songs`` to download a collection of songs in three ways,

* in :numref:`download_by_artist_songs`, by specifying artist and list of songs.

* in :numref:`download_by_artist_album`, by specifying artist and album.

* in :numref:`download_by_artists_songs_list`, by specifying a corresponding list of songs with matching artists.

and using three music metadata services: Gracenote_, LastFM_, and MusicBrainz_. The Gracenote_ service is used or started with by default, but,

* ``-L`` or ``--lastfm`` says to use or start with the LastFM_ API.

* ``-M`` or ``--musicbrainz`` says to use or start with the MusicBrainz_ API.

* At most only one of ``-L``/``--lastfm`` or ``-M``/``--musicbrainz`` can be specified.

Each of the three operations can be either *progressive* or *exclusive*.

.. _progressive_selection:

* *progressive* means that the selection and downloading of songs starts with a given music service. If that service does not work, then it continues by order until successful. For example, if the Gracenote_ service does not work, then try LastFM_; if LastFM_ does not work, then try MusicBrainz_; if MusicBrainz_ does not work, then give up. :numref:`order_progress_music_service` summarizes how this process works, based on the metadata choice flag (``--lastfm``, ``--musicbrainz``, or none). The number in each cell determines the order in which to try until success -- 1 means 1st, 2 means 2nd, etc.

   .. _order_progress_music_service:

      * - ``--musicbrainz``

	- 1

.. _exclusive_selection:
   
* *exclusive* means that the selection of downloading of songs *only uses* a single given music service; if the songs cannot be found using it, then it gives up. :numref:`order_exclusive_music_service` summarizes how this process works, matching metadata flag to music service.

  .. _order_exclusive_music_service:

Once the metadata service finds the metadata for those songs, the CLI provides a selection of YouTube_ clips corresponding to a given song *AND* what the music metadata service thinks is the best match to the selected song. Each clip also shows the length (in MM:SS format) to let you choose one that is high ranking and whose length best matches the song's length.

.. _example_song_youtube_clip:

Here ``howdy_music_songs`` looks for a song, Remember_ by Air_, using the music service MusicBrainz_,

1. The service finds the match and prints out the artist, album, and song.
       	       	     	 
   .. code-block:: console
   
      ACTUAL ARTIST: Air
      ACTUAL ALBUM: Moon Safari
      ACTUAL SONG: Remember (02:34)

   MusicBrainz_ always gives the song length after the song name (ACTUAL SONG row). LastFM_ may do so if it can find the song's length (by internally using the MusicBrainz_ API). Gracenote_ does not have the song length information.
   
2. A selection of candidate YouTube_ clips are given, each with duration. I find it best to choose a clip that is as highly ranked as possible and whose duration matches the actual song's duration (if provided).

   .. code-block:: console

      ACTUAL ARTIST: Air
      ACTUAL ALBUM: Moon Safari
      ACTUAL SONG: Remember (02:34)
      Choose YouTube video:
      1: Air - Remember (04:13)
      2: Remember (02:35)
      3: Air - Remember (02:49)
      4: Remember (David Whitaker Version) (02:22)
      5: Air - Remember – Live in San Francisco (03:04)
      6: Air - Remember (03:41)
      7: Air - Remember – Outside Lands 2016, Live in San Francisco (02:40)
      8: Air - Remember (Original Mix) (03:14)
      9: AIR - Remember live@ FOX Oakland (02:38)
      10: Air - Remember (02:24)

3. Make a selection from the command line, such as ``2`` (because the high ranking clip's duration matches the song's duration very closely). The song then downloads into the file, ``Air.Remember.m4a``, in the current working directory.

   .. code-block:: console

      ACTUAL ARTIST: Air

Here, one uses the `--new`` flag and specifies, IN ORDER, the artists (using the ``--artists`` argument) and respective songs (using the ``--songs`` argument)  to download the collection of songs. Artists are separated by ";" and songs are separated by ";". The metadata service to use here is :ref:`exclusive <exclusive_selection>`. For example, to get these two songs by two different artists using the MusicBrainz_ service,

upload_to_gmusic
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The help output, when running ``upload_to_gmusic -h``, produces the following.

.. code-block:: console

   usage: upload_to_gmusic [-h] -f FILENAMES [-P] [--noverify]

   optional arguments:
     -h, --help            show this help message and exit
     -f FILENAMES, --filenames FILENAMES
			   Give the list of filenames to put into the Google
			   Music Player.
     -P                    If chosen, then push Google Music API Mobileclient
			   credentials into the configuration database.
     --noverify            If chosen, do not verify SSL connections.

The ``--noverify`` flag disables verification of SSL HTTP connections. The standard operation of this tool is to *upload* songs to your `Google Play Music`_ account. The ``-f`` or ``--filenames`` argument can take semicolon-delimited filenames, or standard POSIX globs, for example,

.. code-block:: console

   upload_to_gmusic -f "Air.*m4a"

attempts to upload all filenames that match ``Air.*m4a``.

The other mode of operation, running with the ``-P`` flag without specifying files to upload, attempts to refresh the :py:mod:`gmusicapi` :py:class:`Mobileclient <gmusicapi.Mobileclient>` OAuth2 credentials. Its operation is similar to that of :ref:`howdy_store_credentials`. These dialogs in the shell appear,

.. code-block:: console

   tanim-desktop $ upload_to_gmusic -P
   Please go to this URL in a browser window:https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth...
   After giving permission for Google services on your behalf,
   type in the access code:

Second, go to the URL to which you are instructed. Once you copy that URL into your browser, you will follow a set of prompts asking you to choose which Google account to allow access, and to allow permissions for this app to access your `Google Play Music`_ account.

Third, paste the code similar to as described in :ref:`Step #7 <google_step07_oauthtokencopy>` into the interactive text dialog, ``...type in the access code:``. Once successful, you will receive this message in the shell,

.. code-block:: console

   Success. Stored GMusicAPI Mobileclient credentials.

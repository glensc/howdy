Howdy Email Functionality
================================================
These command line executables, graphical user interfaces, and APIs are used to send one-off announcement, or newsletter style emails. Tautulli_ is a much better tool for sending out newsletter style emails, although this functionality still exists.

This documentation is organized into sections on :ref:`howdy_email_notif`, the Howdy one-off emailing command line interface; :ref:`howdy_email_gui`, the Howdy one-off emailing and newslettering GUI; the :ref:`low level API <Howdy Email API>`; and finally the :ref:`TODO <Howdy Email TODO>`.

Howdy Email TODO
------------------
The Howdy! Email GUI, CLI, and API functionality is fairly robust, but I have not exercised its functionality in months. I may see the need to enhance its functionality, or fix pressing bugs, as I reexamine this space.

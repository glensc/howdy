This documentation is organized into sections on :ref:`get_mov_tor.py`, CLI used to search and download movies; :ref:`plex_tmdb_totgui.py`, the GUI used to manage and search through your Plex movie library, and to search and download new movies; the :ref:`low level API <PlexTMDB API>`; and finally the :ref:`TODO <Plex TMDB TODO>`.

Plex TMDB TODO
------------------

The Plex TMDB GUI, CLI, and API functionality is fairly robust, and I see no pressing need to add functionality here. I only see the need to fix bugs and improve the operation of current tools.

TODO
-------
Here are some things I would like to finish.

* Fill out documentation for all the CLIs (|cbox|) and GUIs.
* Fill out documentation for the lower level APIs (|cbox|) and the GUI APIs.
* Setup-ify this repository as a ``howdy`` Python module (|cbox|).
* Fill out help dialogs for the GUIs.
* Complete the testing suite.
* Streamline the OAuth2_ authentication process, and provide more logical authorization and verification work flows.
* Transition GUIs to use PyQt5_ (|cbox|), with the eventual use of fbs_.

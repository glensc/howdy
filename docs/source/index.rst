Plexstuff - Yet Another Way to Manage Your Plex_ Server's Content
###################################################################

Plexstuff is a (hopefully) useful SDK that I have developed to manage (and download) the movies, television shows, and music in which I am interested. I hope that it is, or becomes, a worthy member of the rich community of services used to manage one's media.

Here are a few of the best known high level media management services:

* `Radarr <https://radarr.video/>`_ or `Couchpotato <https://couchpota.to/>`_ to manage your movies (automatically download them, etc.).
* `Sonarr <https://sonarr.tv/>`_ or `Sickrage <https://www.sickrage.ca/>`_ to manage your television shows (automatically download them as they become available, for instance).
* `Lidarr <https://lidarr.audio/>`_ to manage your music.
* `Subliminal <https://subliminal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ to download movie and TV show subtitles.

Here are some of the best known lower APIs used to help one manage your Plex_ server.

* `Tautulli <https://tautulli.com>`_ to monitor your Plex_ server.
* `Jackett <https://github.com/Jackett/Jackett>`_ is a relatively successful proxy server that consolidates the torrent search from aÂ´ large number of public, private, and semi-private torrent trackers and services into a single search user interface and API. I discuss this in more detail in :numref:`The Jackett Server`.
* `PlexAPI <PlexAPI_>`_ are the unofficial bindings to the Plex API. They are based off the older `unofficial Plex API <unofficial_plex_api_>`_. I still use `the older lower-level REST API <unofficial_plex_api_>`_ because it seems to offer more freedom (such as finer grained multithreaded HTTP requests, and access to remote servers) than PlexAPI_.

TODO
-------

Here are some things I would like to finish.

* Fill out documentation for all the CLIs and GUIs.
* Fill out documentation for the lower level APIs.
* Fill out help dialogs for the CLIs and GUIs.
* Complete the testing suite.
* Streamline the OAuth2 authentication process, and provide more logical authorization and verification work flows.
* Transition GUIs to use PyQt5_, with the eventual use of fbs_.

Howdy Movie Functionality

These command line executables, graphical user interfaces, and APIs are used to download new movies, and search and manage your Plex_ movie library. This documentation is organized into sections on :ref:`get_mov_tor`, CLI used to search and download movies; :ref:`howdy_movie_totgui_label`, the GUI used to manage and search through your Plex movie library, and to search and download new movies; the :ref:`low level API <Howdy Movie API>`; and finally the :ref:`TODO <Howdy Movie TODO>`.

Howdy Movie TODO
------------------
The Howdy Movie GUI, CLI, and API functionality is fairly robust, and I see no pressing need to add functionality here. I only see the need to fix bugs and improve the operation of current tools.

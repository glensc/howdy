Plex Music Functionality
================================================

These command line executables, graphical user interfaces, and APIs are used to download and manage your music (even if the music has been spread between different main directories). This document is organized into sections on :ref:`command line tools <Music Command Line Utilities>` and the :ref:`lower level API <Plex Music API>`.

Plex Music TODO
-----------------

Create a comprehensive GUI for the Plex_ music library similar to what I have made for the TV library (:ref:`plex_tvdb_totgui.py`) and movie library (:ref:`plex_tmdb_totgui.py`).

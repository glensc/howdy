Plex Email Functionality
================================================

These command line executables, graphical user interfaces, and APIs are used to send one-off announcement, or newsletter style emails. Tautulli_ is a much better tool for sending out newsletter style emails, although this functionality still exists.

This documentation is organized into sections on :ref:`plex_email_notif.py`, the Plexstuff one-off emailing command line interface; :ref:`plex_email_gui.py`, the Plexstuff one-off emailing and newslettering GUI; the :ref:`low level API <Plex Email API>`; and finally the :ref:`TODO <Plex Email TODO>`.

Plex Email TODO
------------------

The Plex Email GUI, CLI, and API functionality is fairly robust, but I have not exercised its functionality in months. I may see the need to enhance its functionality, or fix pressing bugs, as I reexamine this space.

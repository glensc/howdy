Core Command Line Utilities
================================================

This section describes the two Plexstuff core command line utilities.

* ``plex_core_cli.py`` does this...

* ``plex_deluge_console.py`` is a mocked up Deluge_ client, whose operation is very similar to the `deluge-console <deluge_console_>`_ command line interface. It is designed for the most common operations of the Deluge_ command line tool, using Deluge_ server settings that are described in :numref:`Plexstuff Settings Configuration` and :numref:`Login Services`.

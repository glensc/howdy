Core GUIs
================================================

These are the Plexstuff core GUIs.

* ``plex_config_gui.py``, the configuration tool used to get the full Plexstuff functionality. Its usage is described in :numref:`Consolidating Plexstuff Configuration With ``plex_config_gui.py```.

* ``plex_core_gui.py`` is a more archaic version of Plexstuff settings configuration. This only provides a GUI to set up the correct Plex server settings or to set up Google OAuth2 authentication.

Core Functionality
================================================

These command line executables, graphical user interfaces, and APIs form the core functionality in Plexstuff. The API lives in ``plexstuff.plexcore``. These tools form the infrastructural basis of higher level tools to manage :ref:`television shows <TVDB Functionality>`, :ref:`movies <TMDB Functionality>`, :ref:`music <Music Functionality>`, and :ref:`email <Email Functionality>`.

This documentation is organized into sections on :ref:`command line tools <Core Command Line Utilities>`, :ref:`GUI tools <Core GUIs>`, and finally on the :ref:`low level API <Core API>`.

Plex Core Functionality
================================================

These command line executables, graphical user interfaces, and APIs form the core functionality in Plexstuff. The API lives in ``plexstuff.plexcore``. These tools form the infrastructural basis of higher level tools to manage :ref:`television shows <Plex TVDB Functionality>`, :ref:`movies <Plex TMDB Functionality>`, :ref:`music <Howdy Music Functionality>`, and :ref:`email <Howdy Email Functionality>`.

This documentation is organized into sections on :ref:`command line tools <Core Command Line Utilities>`, :ref:`GUI tools <Core GUIs>`, :ref:`low level API <Core API>`, and finally the :ref:`TODO <Plex Core TODO>`.

Plex Core TODO
------------------

* Enhance :ref:`plex_create_texts` to allow for the more versatile reStructuredText_ to be converted into HTML documents.

* Implement a PyQt5_ GUI to manipulate torrents on the remote Deluge_ server -- something much reduced from the full functionality of the `Deluge WebUI`_.
